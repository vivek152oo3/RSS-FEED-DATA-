It&#8217;s one of the city&#8217;s five universities ravaged by the Islamic State and the battle to oust it.</p>\\n<p>Now that the battle is over, a new danger looms, the trail of land mines and booby-traps left by ISIS.</p>\\n<p>So this is the wire, and this is where it was buried.</p>\\n<p><strong>CHRISTIAN,</strong>\\xa0Team Leader, Janus Global Operations: Yes, they would cut the asphalt, and then they lay the wire in and put the main charge here.</p>\\n<p><strong>MARCIA BIGGS:</strong> We spent the day with Christian, a team leader from Janus Global, a security and risk management firm hired by the U.S. government to sweep and clear major areas of unexploded ordnance and mines.</p>\\n<p>He&#8217;s not allowed to show his face or use his last name, for security reasons.</p>\\n<p><strong>CHRISTIAN:</strong> There&#8217;s actually two more on that road before we get to the target building that have to be excavated and/or rendered safe.</p>\\n<p><strong>MARCIA BIGGS:</strong> So, the first building you have to clear, you have got to get rid of the IEDs on the road to that building?</p>\\n<p><strong>CHRISTIAN:</strong> Yes.</p>\\n<p><strong>MARCIA BIGGS:</strong> It&#8217;s a long process.</p>\\n<p><strong>CHRISTIAN:</strong> It is, but that&#8217;s what makes it interesting.</p>\\n<p><strong>MARCIA BIGGS:</strong> The United States has sunk $30 million this year into clearing former ISIS territories all over Northern Iraq. Under this program, Janus has already cleared 727 buildings, removing 3,000 IEDs, which they say ISIS was producing on assembly lines at an industrial scale.</p>\\n<p>But State Department officials and experts say the number of unexploded ordnance in Mosul itself is unprecedented.</p>\\n<p>What&#8217;s your first line of attack, in terms of trying to clear Mosul?</p>\\n<p><strong>CHRISTIAN:</strong> Our priority is more the community, rather than the individual, you know, infrastructure. You have got schools, power, sewer, water, so that the area can accept people back into it. And then, once this stabilization phase is over, we can move into the individual homes, so that they can be safer.</p>\\n<p><strong>MARCIA BIGGS:</strong> Clearing Mosul is a process that they say could take years, even decades. So Janus is training local Iraqis to do the job, sending them out as a front-line search team, then investigating and removing any suspicious items themselves.</p>\\n<p><strong>CHRISTIAN:</strong> We&#8217;re not going to be here the whole time, so when we &#8212; it&#8217;s our time to leave, they will have the capacity built from us, and the mentoring we have done, so that they can do it on their own.</p>\\n<p><strong>MARCIA BIGGS:</strong> How are they doing?</p>\\n<p><strong>CHRISTIAN:</strong> They&#8217;re &#8212; a lot of them are very apt to learn. They&#8217;re quick. They&#8217;re smart.</p>\\n<p><strong>MARCIA BIGGS:</strong> Fawzi al Nabdi is the team leader for the Iraqi local partner. He&#8217;s cleared mines all over Iraq for the last six years.</p>\\n<p><strong>CHRISTIAN:</strong> What you got?</p>\\n<p><strong>FAWZI AL NABDI,</strong> Team Leader, Al Fahad Company (through interpreter): We are ready for this, because it&#8217;s my job and I love it. The Americans are here to complete our work and to help us. They have greater experience than we do. If we find any mines, we have to stop and they will investigate it and make a plan to remove it.</p>\\n<p><strong>MARCIA BIGGS:</strong> But he says Mosul is the biggest project he has ever seen, and we&#8217;re told it could take at least a month to just get the campus cleared of mines. Only then can they start cleaning it up, so that students can resume classes, this itself a huge task.</p>\\n<p>ISIS fighters closed the university back in 2014, and used it as a military base. As coalition forces pounded ISIS targets, this seat of higher learning became a battleground.</p>\\n<p>Ghassan Alubaidy is the institute&#8217;s dean.</p>\\n<p><strong>GHASSAN ALUBAIDY,</strong> Dean, Mosul Technical Institute (through interpreter): ISIS used our university to manufacture mines and bombs. For this reason, it was the target of airstrikes in the beginning. They struck the institute nine times, and they struck our workshops, too. Now we can&#8217;t use them.</p>\\n<p><strong>MARCIA BIGGS:</strong> The former commander of coalition forces in Iraq, Lieutenant General Stephen Townsend, recently listed 81 locations where bombs were dropped, but had not yet exploded.</p>\\n<p>Facilities used to make weapons were often on the list of high-value targets for the coalition. So now those places are twice as likely to contain dangerous items.</p>\\n<p>So, this was once a workshop for electrical engineering students. You can still see the lab tables here. It was hit by an airstrike in 2015. Afterwards, members of the university staff found bomb-making instructions among the rubble. This was likely an ISIS bomb-making factory, and judging by the crater, a high-value target.</p>\\n<p>Despite the damage, Dean Alubaidy says he will hold classes this fall in alternate buildings, until the campus is ready. He&#8217;s expecting registration to be in the thousands, students who lost three years of education during the fighting and don&#8217;t want to lose another one.</p>\\n<p><strong>GHASSAN ALUBAIDY</strong> (through interpreter): On our Facebook pages, we found a great number of students posting that they were full of encouragement to come back. For us, it was unbelievable. We couldn&#8217;t imagine it, to see how many students wanted to start again, how they were dreaming of the first day of classes, when they could sit in front of teachers again and start to live their lives again.</p>\\n<p><strong>MARCIA BIGGS:</strong> Next door, Mosul University has already started classes. Students even volunteered to help in the cleanup.</p>\\n<p>But across the river, West Mosul was the site of ISIS&#8217; last stand and bore the brunt of the battle. It&#8217;s densely packed Old City, with its flattened buildings, is a challenge for mine-sweeping.</p>\\n<p><strong>FAWZI AL-NABDI</strong> (through interpreter): Most of the homes here were full of mines. And just here in front of us, a man with two kids came back to his home, and when he opened the door, the bomb killed him and his kids.</p>\\n<p><strong>MARCIA BIGGS:</strong> Ahmed Younes fled back in early July with only the clothes on his back. Residents have been virtually banned from returning to his neighborhood on the outskirts of the Old City, but Ahmed said he got special permission, in order to retrieve some personal items.</p>\\n<p><strong>AHMED YOUNES,</strong> Local Resident (through interpreter): We came on our own. We got permission to come, but they are not responsible if anything happens to us.</p>\\n<p><strong>MARCIA BIGGS:</strong> Right now, there is no plan to begin clearing the Old City or even to determine how many mines there are. It is still out of bounds to anyone but the Iraqi security forces.</p>\\n<p>So the Janus team is focusing on progress in the rest of the city, building by building, bomb by bomb.</p>\\n<p><strong>CHRISTIAN:</strong> Whoever made this device had a set goal. And to allow him to win, people get hurt. So you kind of compete against him to be better than him to take it out before it can do any harm.</p>\\n<p><strong>MARCIA BIGGS:</strong> So, you feel like you&#8217;re winning the battle against ISIS?</p>\\n<p>CHRISTIAN: Yes, one IED at a time.</p>\\n<p><strong>MARCIA BIGGS:</strong> For the PBS NewsHour, I&#8217;m Marcia Biggs in Mosul, Iraq.</p>\\n<p><strong>HARI SREENIVASAN:</strong> Tune in later.</p>\\n<p>Frontline&#8217;s latest film, &#8220;Mosul,&#8221; was on the ground filming the fight as it unfolded street by street and house by house.

More than 580,000 refugees have fled to neighboring Bangladesh since late August.</p>\\n<p>&#8220;We really hold the military leadership accountable for what&#8217;s happening,&#8221; Tillerson said at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington think tank. &#8220;What&#8217;s most important to us is that the world can&#8217;t just stand idly by and be witness to the atrocities that are being reported in that area.&#8221;</p>\\n<p>He also called Wednesday for the U.S. and India to expand strategic ties. He pointedly criticized China, which he accused of challenging international norms needed for global stability.</p>\\n<p>He said the world needed the U.S. and India to have a strong partnership. The two nations share goals of security, free navigation, free trade and fighting terrorism in the Indo-Pacific, and serve as &#8220;the eastern and western beacons&#8221; for an international rules-based order which is increasingly under strain, he said.</p>\\n<p>Both India and China had benefited from that order, but Tillerson said India had done so while respecting rules and norms, while China had &#8220;at times&#8221; undermined them. To make his point, he alluded to China&#8217;s island building and expansive territorial claims in seas where Beijing has long-running disputes with Southeast Asian neighbors.</p>\\n<p>&#8220;China&#8217;s provocative actions in the South China Sea directly challenge the international law and norms that the United States and India both stand for,&#8221; Tillerson said in an address at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington think tank.</p>\\n<p>He added that the U.S. seeks constructive relations with China but &#8220;won&#8217;t shrink&#8221; from the challenges it poses when it &#8220;subverts the sovereignty of neighboring countries, and disadvantages the U.S. and our friends.&#8221;</p>\\n<p>U.S.-India relations have generally prospered in the past decade, in part because of their shared concerns about the rise of China. While President Donald Trump has looked to deepen cooperation with China on addressing the nuclear threat from North Korea, he&#8217;s also sought a closer relationship with India, which shares U.S. worries on Islamic extremism.</p>\\n<p>&#8220;In this period of uncertainty and angst, India needs a reliable partner on the world stage. I want to make clear: with our shared values and vision for global stability, peace and prosperity, the United States is that partner,&#8221; Tillerson said.</p>\\n<p>Tillerson said the U.S. wants to help improve India&#8217;s military capabilities, and also improve security cooperation among the region&#8217;s major democracies, which included Japan and Australia.</p>\\n<p>Tillerson said the U.S. and India were leading regional efforts on counterterrorism.

I want my children to have a secure future. I want them not only for them to have a secure Sweden. I want them to have a secure world. And I want other people to fight for the same thing.</p>\\n<p><strong>MALCOLM BRABANT:</strong> When addressing her fellow neo-Nazis, Forslund&#8217;s rhetoric sharpens.</p>\\n<p><strong>PAULINA FORSLUND</strong> (through interpreter): I&#8217;m the welder&#8217;s daughter, the forester&#8217;s grandchild. My line consists of hardworking men and women. It&#8217;s people like them we can thank for the welfare system that our lying politicians are now giving away to imported scum.</p>\\n<p><strong>MALCOLM BRABANT:</strong> Clearly expecting trouble, the movement&#8217;s leaders have a muscular protection detail, marching past a silent protest. The sign reads &#8220;No Nazis on our streets.&#8221;</p>\\n<p>This protester would only give her name as Johanna.</p>\\n<p><strong>JOHANNA,</strong> Anti-Nazi Protester: They are racist people. They are people who think that certain people are better than others, and I will not stand for that. It&#8217;s not something I think has a place in a modern society.</p>\\n<p><strong>MALCOLM BRABANT:</strong> Experts say the resistance movement is recruiting aggressively, and believe this demonstration is emblematic of the rise of the far right.</p>\\n<p>It took place on Yom Kippur, the Jewish day of atonement.</p>\\n<p>Allan Stutzinky is leader of Gothenburg&#8217;s Jewish community.</p>\\n<p><strong>ALLAN STUTZINKY,</strong>\\xa0Jewish Community Leader (through interpreter): Nazism has returned. The descendants of the murderers are organizing the same marches today, waving the same flags, shouting the same slogans, and have the same racist agenda.</p>\\n<p><strong>MALCOLM BRABANT:</strong> Anna Johansson is a member of the governing Social Democrat Party. It&#8217;s considering outlawing the Nordic Resistance Movement.</p>\\n<p><strong>ANNA JOHANSSON,</strong>\\xa0Swedish Social Democratic Party: In Sweden and in Denmark, and in other countries, extreme parties are growing, and the hatred is spreading around.</p>\\n<p><strong>MALCOLM BRABANT:</strong> &#8220;Go home to mama,&#8221; he shouts. &#8220;Nazi pigs,&#8221; chant the anti- fascist protesters, as a bottle flies through the air.</p>\\n<p><strong>DAMON,</strong> Nordic Resistance Movement: If someone calls themselves a Nazi, most of us would dissociate with that person. That&#8217;s nothing we stand for ourselves. I never call myself a Nazi. I&#8217;m a national socialist.</p>\\n<p><strong>MALCOLM BRABANT:</strong> Hitler&#8217;s party was also called National Socialist, but Damon, a 40-year-old welder, insists he&#8217;s a nonviolent family man.</p>\\n<p><strong>DAMON:</strong> The demographic landscape of our &#8212; of the whole of Europe is changing, so, basically, it&#8217;s a concern on preserving my heritage for my family and our kin.</p>\\n<p><strong>MALCOLM BRABANT:</strong> This demonstration has been stopped short of its destination. The Nordic Resistance Movement is currently trapped between a line of police and anti-fascist protesters. And it looks as though this demonstration isn&#8217;t going any further.</p>\\n<p>Violence briefly erupts as the resistance movement tries to break through police lines, and several marchers are arrested.</p>\\n<p><strong>PAULINA FORSLUND</strong>: We are not your enemy. We are the government&#8217;s enemy.</p>\\n<p>They say we live in a democracy, but we have never had an election about if we want to take all these people in.</p>\\n<p><strong>MALCOLM BRABANT:</strong> When Europe&#8217;s refugee crisis began in 2015, Sweden copied Germany&#8217;s open-door policy, and 160,000 migrants entered the country. Two years on, Sweden has tighter borders and has begun deporting some of the newcomers.</p>\\n<p>The new atmosphere alarms Floid Gumbo, entertaining an anti-Nazi rally.</p>\\n<p><strong>FLOID GUMBO,</strong> Singer Originally from Zimbabwe: I came to Sweden over 20 years ago. The climate in Sweden, the people were so friendly, and things were completely different, more welcoming. And I feel like things have sort of gradually changed.</p>\\n<p>I&#8217;m very concerned, because I have children, because I&#8217;m thinking what I experienced here is not the same kind of climate, atmosphere that they are going to experience here.</p>\\n<p><strong>ANNA JOHANSSON:</strong> It&#8217;s not so long ago that the Nazis ruined Europe. And that makes me very worried. The German elections were terrifying, I think.</p>\\n<p><strong>MALCOLM BRABANT:</strong> Johansson is referring to last month&#8217;s success of the right-wing Alternative For Germany Party, or AFD, when it entered Parliament for the first time with 13 percent of the vote.</p>\\n<p><strong>HUGH BRONSON,</strong> Alternative For Germany Party: The AFD only came into existence because Merkel deserted the traditional conservative Christian voters. They were looking for a home, and the AFD has offered them a safe place.</p>\\n<p><strong>MALCOLM BRABANT:</strong> Hugh Bronson is deputy leader of the AFD in Berlin.</p>\\n<p>Now his party, the third largest in Parliament, is demanding that Angela Merkel imposes tougher immigration rules.</p>\\n<p>Your opponents claim that you are a party of hate. What&#8217;s your response to that?</p>\\n<p><strong>HUGH BRONSON:</strong> We embrace foreigners who respect our laws, pay their taxes, send their children to school, and go about their normal life. The problem is with people who abuse the system to have a better life, or let others pay for their better lives, or who are criminals.</p>\\n<p><strong>MALCOLM BRABANT:</strong> Outside the opera house in Dresden, former East Germany, singer Luca Bergelt is dismayed by the political landscape shifting to the right.</p>\\n<p><strong>LUCA BERGELT,</strong>\\xa0Singer: My fear is that they will tear Europe apart. They are going to raise up the walls again. They&#8217;re going to build new walls between the countries, and that Europe will get more close into itself.</p>\\n<p><strong>MALCOLM BRABANT:</strong> Anti-immigrant sentiment is strong in Dresden. The city was the birthplace of a pan-European anti-Islamic movement, and it delivered the largest number of votes for the right-wing party.</p>\\n<p>On a holiday to celebrate German unification after the fall of communism, retired engineer Wilfried Schmidt explained why he sent a message to Angela Merkel.</p>\\n<p><strong>WILFRIED SCHMIDT,</strong>\\xa0Retired Engineer\\xa0(through interpretor): Let&#8217;s put it this way. We all need to recognize that Germany is undergoing social changes that are becoming harder to control. For one, there is mass immigration from difficult regions that is increasingly uncontrollable, of people with entirely different concepts of life, from fundamental differently structured societies that are problematic.</p>\\n<p><strong>MALCOLM BRABANT:</strong> About one million migrants poured into Germany in 2015. Chancellor Merkel consistently defended her pro-refugee policies, but now she has been punished by voters who believe she ignored their concerns.</p>\\n<p>Chancellor Merkel has promised to listen to the people who voted for the AFD, and she says she&#8217;s going to try to win them over with what she calls good politics. But she will not countenance having the party in her coalition.</p>\\n<p>But the chancellor needs to find new partners who are prepared to be tough on immigration.</p>\\n<p>As she tries to forge a coalition, the chancellor has agreed to put an annual cap of 200,000 on the number of immigrants, something she previously refused to do. But will it be enough to woo back people who deserted her at the election?</p>\\n<p>A question for Werner Patzelt, a political scientist at Dresden University.</p>\\n<p><strong>WERNER PATZELT,</strong> Dresden University: Since Chancellor Merkel has made so many U-turns in German domestic politics, it wouldn&#8217;t be a surprise if she would try to do a U-turn, also winning back AFD voters.</p>\\n<p>But this is a really hard political task, because so many of them are so much disappointed by the Christian Democratic Union in general, and by Chancellor Merkel in particular, that they will do anything to avoid going back.</p>\\n<p><strong>MALCOLM BRABANT:</strong> Back in Sweden, the governing party is horrified at the concept of conceding ground to right-wingers, and is trying to isolate them.</p>\\n<p><strong>ANNA JOHANSSON:</strong> Experience shows that, when you adopt the ideas from these right-wing parties, they spread. These parties have their agenda implemented by other parties. And I wouldn&#8217;t want to see that happen in Sweden.</p>\\n<p><strong>FLOID GUMBO:</strong> We&#8217;re all human beings. We share this world. We&#8217;re all here. There&#8217;s enough space for us all.</p>\\n<p><strong>MALCOLM BRABANT:</strong> But that&#8217;s an appeal that an increasing number of Swedes are rejecting, as the country and much of Europe go through a crisis of identity.</p>\\n<p>For the PBS NewsHour, I&#8217;m Malcolm Brabant in Gothenburg.</p>\\n<p>The post <a href=\"http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/far-right-groups-gain-ground-sweden-germany-amid-migrant-influx/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Far-right groups gain ground in Sweden and Germany amid migrant influx</a> appeared first on <a href=\"http://www.pbs.org/newshour\" rel=\"nofollow\">PBS NewsHour</a>.</p>'}], 'wfw_commentrss': 'http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/far-right-groups-gain-ground-sweden-germany-amid-migrant-influx/feed/', 'slash_comments': '0', 'itunes_duration': '9:12', 'media_content': [{'url': 'http://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/newshour/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/RTS1GSQT-1024x659.jpg', 'medium': 'image'}]}, {'title': 'U.S.-backed Syrian forces recapture Raqqa from Islamic State group', 'title_detail': {'type': 'text/plain', 'language': None, 'base': 'http://feeds.feedburner.com/NewshourWorld', 'value': 'U.S.-backed Syrian forces recapture Raqqa from Islamic State group'}, 'links': [{'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html', 'href': 'http://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/u-s-backed-syrian-forces-recapture-raqqa-from-islamic-state-group/'}], 'link': 'http://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/u-s-backed-syrian-forces-recapture-raqqa-from-islamic-state-group/', 'comments': 'http://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/u-s-backed-syrian-forces-recapture-raqqa-from-islamic-state-group/#respond', 'published': 'Tue, 17 Oct 2017 16:57:20 +0000', 'published_parsed': time.struct_time(tm_year=2017, tm_mon=10, tm_mday=17, tm_hour=16, tm_min=57, tm_sec=20, tm_wday=1, tm_yday=290, tm_isdst=0), 'authors': [{'name': 'Larisa Epatko'}], 'author': 'Larisa Epatko', 'author_detail': {'name': 'Larisa Epatko'}, 'tags': [{'term': 'islamic state group', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}, {'term': 'raqqa', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}, {'term': 'Syria', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}], 'id': 'http://www.pbs.org/newshour/?post_type=rundown&p=230913', 'guidislink': False, 'summary': 'U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces announced Tuesday that they had captured the city of Raqqa from Islamic State militants.', 'summary_detail': {'type': 'text/plain', 'language': None, 'base': 'http://feeds.feedburner.com/NewshourWorld', 'value': 'U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces announced Tuesday that they had captured the city of Raqqa from Islamic State militants.'}, 'content': [{'type': 'text/html', 'language': None, 'base': 'http://feeds.feedburner.com/NewshourWorld', 'value': '<div class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_230912\" style=\"width: 689px;\"></div>\\n<p>U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces announced Tuesday that they had <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-41646802\">captured the city of Raqqa</a> from Islamic State militants.</p>\\n<p>&#8220;Everything is finished in Raqqa, our forces have taken full control of Raqqa,&#8221; SDF spokesman Talal Sello told <a href=\"https://www.afp.com/en/news/23/islamic-state-group-loses-emblematic-syria-stronghold-raqa\">AFP</a>.

By midday, Iraqi soldiers, along with state-backed militias, quickly took control of several massive oil fields north of the city. Iraqis also captured Kirkuk&#8217;s military airport and various government buildings. They lowered what had been a symbolic Kurdish flag at the governor&#8217;s compound.</p>\\n<p>Journalist Rebecca Collard in Irbil was in Kirkuk this morning.</p>\\n<p><strong>REBECCA COLLARD,</strong> Journalist: You could hear some clashes, some gunfire in the distance, but for the most part, the city seemed more or less abandoned. Now, the Iraqi army, by the end of today, was essentially in control of the whole city and many of the outskirts of Kirkuk.</p>\\n<p><strong>LISA DESJARDINS:</strong> The spokesman for an Iraqi Shiite militia said they achieved all their goals with little resistance.</p>\\n<p><strong>AHMED AL-ASSADI,\\xa0</strong> Spokesman for al-Hashed al-Shaabi\\xa0(through translator): As the troops approached the area, they were confronted by some rebels, who tried to hinder the progress of the advancing units. Our troops returned fire and silenced its source.</p>\\n<p><strong>LISA DESJARDINS:</strong> This comes three weeks after the Kurds held a nonbinding independence referendum that included the disputed province of Kirkuk.</p>\\n<p>More than 90 percent of the Kurdish region&#8217;s residents voted to split from Iraq. The Iraqi federal government, Turkey, Iran and the U.S. all rejected the independence drive.</p>\\n<p>The multiethnic region of Kirkuk lies just outside of the autonomous Kurdish region in Iraq&#8217;s north. Called the country&#8217;s oil capital, Kirkuk produces around 500,000 barrels a day.</p>\\n<p>In 2014, amid the ISIS onslaught across Northern Iraq, the Kurds took control of Kirkuk, as the Iraqi military fled the city. In the three years since, the Kurds, led by their president, Massoud Barzani, sought to cement their hold, despite tensions with the central government.</p>\\n<p>Today, Kurdish officials accused Iraq of carrying out a major multipronged attack.</p>\\n<p><strong>MAJ. GEN. AYOUB YUSUF SAID,</strong> Peshmerga Commander (through interpreter): I don&#8217;t know what is happening exactly, because we have been in this fight since 4:00 in the morning. We have suffered casualties, including martyrs, and now we have withdrawn to this position. Some of the other Kurdish forces have pulled out. They didn&#8217;t fire a single shot.</p>\\n<p><strong>LISA DESJARDINS:</strong> While Kurdish forces withdrew from posts south of the city, some residents vowed to die fighting. Thousands of others fled north.</p>\\n<p><strong>REBECCA COLLARD:</strong> For the last few years, the Iraqi forces, these primarily Shia militia, the Hashed Shaabi, and the Kurdish forces have been focused on fighting ISIS. Now that fight is coming to an end, and what the fear is that now these internal division in Iraq are going to become more apparent and possibly more violent.</p>\\n<p><strong>LISA DESJARDINS:</strong> These clashes pit one substantially American-armed military force against another. Both the Kurdish forces and Iraqi government troops are part of the coalition fighting ISIS. The U.S. sought to downplay the fighting, labeling the exchange of gunfire a misunderstanding.</p>\\n<p>And, in the Rose Garden, President Trump tried to stay neutral.</p>\\n<p><strong>PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP:</strong> We don&#8217;t like the fact that they&#8217;re clashing.

She served as an adviser to General David Petraeus while he was commander of U.S. forces in Iraq from 2007 to 2010, and by Feisal Istrabadi. He&#8217;s a former Iraqi ambassador to the United Nations and he helped write Iraq&#8217;s interim constitution.</p>\\n<p>Welcome to both of you.</p>\\n<p>Let me start with you, Emma Sky.</p>\\n<p>This has happened so quickly. What exactly has the Iraqi government done?</p>\\n<p><strong>EMMA SKY,</strong>\\xa0Yale University: The Iraqi government has deployed its forces back up north into Kirkuk.</p>\\n<p>And since 2003, the Kurds have made it clear that they want to include Kirkuk within their territory in order to proceed with gaining independence, which has always been their goal. But Kirkuk is important to Iraq itself, and no Iraqi prime minister can afford to lose Kirkuk.</p>\\n<p>So you can see this reaction that has taken place following the referendum on independence, which happened September the 25th, and also included the disputed territories and the city of Kirkuk.</p>\\n<p><strong>JUDY WOODRUFF:</strong> Feisal Istrabadi, what can you add to why the Iraqi government is so set on taking over the city?</p>\\n<p><strong>FEISAL ISTRABADI,</strong> Former Deputy UN Ambassador, Iraq: Well, a couple of reasons.</p>\\n<p>First, as Emma just said, it is a part of the disputed territories, which are legally and constitutionally under the jurisdiction of the federal government in Baghdad. The KRG expanded into these disputed territories at the time when ISIL was expanding its territory, and then began to take steps to unilaterally declare that these areas were now incorporated into the Kurdistan region, including when it held the referendum that Emma talked about.</p>\\n<p>It included holding the referendum in these disputed territories. Now, so long as Iraq &#8212; so long as we&#8217;re talking about a single country, it matters a little less who controls Kirkuk, but once the referendum was held, this gave rise then to the second reason for Baghdad choosing to act now.</p>\\n<p>As Emma said, Kirkuk is an important oil-producing zone in Iraq. And it is vital for the economic viability of an independent Kurdish state and an important part of the economic viability of the Iraqi state. So there was never going to be a scenario, I think, in which Baghdad would allow a unilateral exercise of control by Kurds to occur over Kirkuk, so long as independence is on the table.</p>\\n<p><strong>JUDY WOODRUFF:</strong> Emma Sky, we heard President Trump say today the U.S. is not taking sides in this.</p>\\n<p>Is that accurate, that the U.S. isn&#8217;t taking sides? What is the U.S. role here?</p>\\n<p><strong>EMMA SKY:</strong> Well, the U.S. has stipulated over and over again that its policy is to support a united Iraq.</p>\\n<p>So you can see the U.S. has given support to Iraqi security forces, but also to the Kurdish Peshmerga, to fight against ISIS. The U.S. policy for the last few years has really been focused on ISIS and not on the day after ISIS.</p>\\n<p>But what we&#8217;re witnessing at the moment is that different groups are already moving to the day after, which is the power struggle for control of different territories in Iraq.</p>\\n<p>And Barzani believed that during the fight against ISIS, he became stronger because he got weapons directly from the international community. And, as Feisal said, he was able to extend his control over the disputed territories.</p>\\n<p>He&#8217;s also facing domestic problems within Kurdistan. There are tensions between the different Kurdish groups, and some believe that Barzani has overstayed his term as president.</p>\\n<p><strong>JUDY WOODRUFF:</strong> Which reminds us just how complicated this is, Feisal Istrabadi.</p>\\n<p>What does the Iraqi central government want here? They&#8217;re not going to get rid of the Kurds. What is it that they want?</p>\\n<p><strong>FEISAL ISTRABADI:</strong> Oh, well, I mean, the Kurds of course are a vital part of Iraq. They&#8217;re a vital part of the political process, and they have been represented in Baghdad. The president of Iraq is a Kurd and has been since 2005.</p>\\n<p>I think what needs to occur and I hope what the government of Iraq wants is a negotiated settlement, in which no party dictates terms to the other, but a negotiated settlement.</p>\\n<p>Look, Irbil has some legitimate agreements with respect to Baghdad. Baghdad has some legitimate agreements with respect to Irbil. I think we need a mediator perhaps or somebody to convene a roundtable &#8212; the United States is who I&#8217;m thinking of, of course &#8212; to address some of those issues.</p>\\n<p>Most of the issues are, from the Irbil side, economic issues of payments, and from Baghdad&#8217;s side, transparency of how much oil Irbil is producing and exporting, which Irbil has never accounted for to Baghdad.</p>\\n<p>I think if those issues are resolved, perhaps hopefully some of these other issues can at least be delayed for another day. But at the end of the day, neither government &#8212; neither the regional government nor the federal government in Baghdad can really tolerate dictation of terms to it by the other side. My hope is that a negotiated settlement obtains.</p>\\n<p><strong>JUDY WOODRUFF:</strong> Emma Sky, where do you see this going from here? Do you see the peace that different sides have worked to hard to create in Iraq unraveling as a result of this?</p>\\n<p><strong>EMMA SKY:</strong> I think there is an opportunity for a deal, and I think the sort of deal that could be negotiated is one that looks at a special status for the city of Kirkuk and negotiated terms for Kurdistan&#8217;s separate, whether that be towards confederation or towards independence.</p>\\n<p>But there needs to be negotiation. There needs to be a look at where should the border between Iraqi Kurdistan and the rest of Iraq actually be, and that requires mediation district by district through those territories.</p>\\n<p><strong>JUDY WOODRUFF:</strong> Well, we know there are other players who are playing an important role here in Iran and Turkey, and this is all very much playing out as we watch, watch it happen in Iraq.</p>\\n<p>Emma Sky, Feisal Istrabadi, thank you very much.</p>\\n<p><strong>FEISAL ISTRABADI:</strong> Thank you.</p>\\n<p><strong>EMMA SKY:</strong> Thank you.</p>\\n<p>The post <a href=\"http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/power-struggle-broken-kirkuk/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Why a power struggle has broken out over Kirkuk</a> appeared first on <a href=\"http://www.pbs.org/newshour\" rel=\"nofollow\">PBS NewsHour</a>.</p>'}], 'wfw_commentrss': 'http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/power-struggle-broken-kirkuk/feed/', 'slash_comments': '0', 'itunes_duration': '10:32', 'media_content': [{'url': 'http://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/newshour/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/RTS1GMUL-1024x629.jpg', 'medium': 'image'}]}, {'title': 'Rex Tillerson says continue diplomacy with North Korea ‘until first bomb drops’', 'title_detail': {'type': 'text/plain', 'language': None, 'base': 'http://feeds.feedburner.com/NewshourWorld', 'value': 'Rex Tillerson says continue diplomacy with North Korea ‘until first bomb drops’'}, 'links': [{'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html', 'href': 'http://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/rex-tillerson-says-continue-diplomacy-north-korea-first-bomb-drops/'}], 'link': 'http://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/rex-tillerson-says-continue-diplomacy-north-korea-first-bomb-drops/', 'comments': 'http://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/rex-tillerson-says-continue-diplomacy-north-korea-first-bomb-drops/#respond', 'published': 'Mon, 16 Oct 2017 11:08:00 +0000', 'published_parsed': time.struct_time(tm_year=2017, tm_mon=10, tm_mday=16, tm_hour=11, tm_min=8, tm_sec=0, tm_wday=0, tm_yday=289, tm_isdst=0), 'authors': [{'name': 'Laura Santhanam'}], 'author': 'Laura Santhanam', 'author_detail': {'name': 'Laura Santhanam'}, 'tags': [{'term': 'Donald Trump', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}, {'term': 'Kim Jong Un', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}, {'term': 'North Korea', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}, {'term': 'Rex Tillerson', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}], 'id': 'http://www.pbs.org/newshour/?post_type=rundown&p=230760', 'guidislink': False, 'summary': 'That statement comes despite President Donald Trump\\'s tweets a couple of weeks ago that his chief envoy was \"wasting his time\" trying to negotiate with \"Little Rocket Man,\" a mocking nickname Trump has given the nuclear-armed nation\\'s leader, Kim Jong Un.', 'summary_detail': {'type': 'text/plain', 'language': None, 'base': 'http://feeds.feedburner.com/NewshourWorld', 'value': 'That statement comes despite President Donald Trump\\'s tweets a couple of weeks ago that his chief envoy was \"wasting his time\" trying to negotiate with \"Little Rocket Man,\" a mocking nickname Trump has given the nuclear-armed nation\\'s leader, Kim Jong Un.'}, 'content': [{'type': 'text/html', 'language': None, 'base': 'http://feeds.feedburner.com/NewshourWorld', 'value': '<div class=\"wp-caption alignright\" id=\"attachment_229698\" style=\"width: 689px;\"></div>\\n<p>WASHINGTON — Secretary of State Rex Tillerson says diplomatic efforts aimed at resolving the North Korean crisis &#8220;will continue until the first bomb drops.&#8221;</p>\\n<p>That statement comes despite President Donald Trump&#8217;s tweets a couple of weeks ago that his chief envoy was &#8220;wasting his time&#8221; trying to negotiate with &#8220;Little Rocket Man,&#8221; a mocking nickname Trump has given the nuclear-armed nation&#8217;s leader, Kim Jong Un.</p>\\n<p>&#8220;I think he does want to be clear with Kim Jong Un and that regime in North Korea that he has military preparations ready to go and he has those military options on the table.

He&#8217;s not seeking to go to war.&#8221;</p>\\n<p>Recent mixed messaging from the top of the U.S. government has raised concerns about the potential for miscalculation amid the increasingly bellicose exchange of words by Trump and the North Korean leader.</p>\\n<p>Trump told the U.N.

He provided no elaboration about those channels or the substance of any discussions.</p>\\n<p>Soon after, Trump took to Twitter, saying he had told &#8220;our wonderful Secretary of State, that he is wasting his time trying to negotiate with Little Rocket Man &#8230; Save your energy Rex, we&#8217;ll do what has to be done!&#8221; Trump offered no further explanation, but he said all military options are on the table for dealing with North Korea&#8217;s nuclear and missile programs.</p>\\n<p>Analysts have speculated about whether the president and his top diplomat were playing &#8220;good cop, bad cop&#8221; with North Korea, and how China might interpret the confusing signals from Washington. Beijing is the North&#8217;s main trading partner, and the U.S. is counting on China to enforce U.N. sanctions.</p>\\n<p>&#8220;Rest assured that the Chinese are not confused in any way what the American policy towards North Korea (is) or what our actions and efforts are directed at,&#8221; Tillerson said.</p>\\n<p>Asked if Trump&#8217;s tweets undermined Tillerson, the secretary said: &#8220;I think what the president is doing is he&#8217;s trying to motivate action on a number of people&#8217;s part, in particular the regime in North Korea.

Iraqi army forces are demanding Kurdish troops withdraw from oil fields and military bases around Kirkuk, a city in the Kurdistan region that voted for independence last month. Kirkuk also has 10% of Iraq&#8217;s known oil reserves. Washington Post&#8217;s Loveday Morris is in Baghdad covering this standoff joins me now via Skype. First of all the significance of this. Why is it so important?</p>\\n<p><strong>LOVEDAY MORRIS:</strong> There&#8217;s been a longtime conflict between Baghdad and Kurdistan over these disputed territories. Most significant of which is Kirkuk because of the oil reserves. But the referendum last month has really sharpened these disputes because you have Baghdad opposing independence and so it feels like they have to restate its territorial claims these areas. So that&#8217;s why we&#8217;re seeing a lot of tension right now. </p>\\n<p><strong>HARI SREENIVASAN:</strong> And just to give people a little bit of a brief timeline &#8211; Iraqi forces control this area for a while and then in June ISIS took over the area and now it&#8217;s kind of back in Kurdish hands?</p>\\n<p><strong>LOVEDAY MORRIS:</strong> Right. So in June 2014 Iraq lost control of a lot of the areas and we have this huge collapse in the face of an ISIS offensive. Over 100,000 soldiers fled and Kurdish forces moved in some of these areas &#8211; some of them maybe took from ISIS and others just moved into into the vacuum. And so Iraqi forces have been in these areas since June 2014. And that&#8217;s their main demand that they return to the areas. </p>\\n<p><strong>HARI SREENIVASAN:</strong> What&#8217;s the likelihood that this standoff right now turns violent? Into some sort of a civil war?</p>\\n<p><strong>LOVEDAY MORRIS:</strong>: I think at this point both sides don&#8217;t want violence. Al-Abadi, the prime minister, is really trying to defuse the situation by saying there&#8217;s going to be no  military attack. But at the same time there is this buildup of forces so that I think they are trying to, in a way, intimidate the Kurds to withdraw from some areas but they don&#8217;t want to see a fight per say.

The conflict began when South Sudan’s army split between factions loyal to President Salva Kiir and former Vice President Riek Machar. The two men mobilized their respective tribes, the Dinka and the Nuer. The war has caused what is now one of the world’s worst refugee crises.</p>\\n<p><strong>SIMONA FOLTYN</strong>: Civil war is emptying huge swaths of South Sudan. The violence has uprooted four million people, including two million who’ve fled to neighboring countries. In the last year, more than a million South Sudanese have poured into northern Uganda alone, crossing makeshift bridges like this one to flee fighting, hunger, and brutal attacks on civilians.</p>\\n<p><strong>SEME LUPAI, REFUGE</strong>E: They started fighting very, very severely. So that made us to escape with our properties to this side.</p>\\n<p><strong>SIMONA FOLTYN</strong>: When Seme Lupai’s family went to one of the refugee camps, initially, he stayed behind to look after the family’s most precious commodity &#8212; their cattle. He hid for a year to escape the violence. The refugees carry whatever they can salvage &#8212; mattresses, pots, clothes, notebooks &#8212; remnants of once peaceful lives turned upside down. At checkpoints, Ugandan soldiers search their belongings for weapons, before the refugees proceed to reception centers. After entering Uganda, the refugees sign in at small waystations. For many, it’s the first night spent in safety after walking for days to escape fighting. Levi Arike fled with his wife and four children.</p>\\n<p><strong>LEVI ARIKE, REFUGEE</strong>: When the gunshots started, we laid under a tree with the whole family, because there was nowhere else to hide. We waited for the fighting to stop, and then we got up and started walking to Uganda.</p>\\n<p><strong>SIMONA FOLTYN</strong>: Uganda now shoulders most of the burden of Africa’s biggest refugee crisis, managing a constellation of camps which require food, water, healthcare, and policing. At Imvepi Camp, now home to more than 120,000 South Sudanese, new arrivals receive vaccinations, hot meals, and basic items such as soap and plastic tarps to build a house. The government also gives each refugee family a small plot of land, about a twentieth of an acre, where they can build a tent shelter and grow crops to eat or sell. But the land often proves too rocky for farming.</p>\\n<p><strong>SIMONA FOLTYN, IMVEPI REFUGEE CAMP, NORTHERN UGANDA</strong>: After completing the registration process, the new arrivals will receive their plot, to start a new life as refugees in Uganda.

Still when I’m sleeping, I’m dreaming of the Dinka, that they are coming to rape me again.</p>\\n<p><strong>SIMONA FOLTYN</strong>: How often do you have those dreams?</p>\\n<p><strong>AGNES</strong>: Daily, every time I lie down, those dreams come.</p>\\n<p><strong>SIMONA FOLTYN</strong>: A recent Human Rights Watch report on South Sudan found “&#8230;a clear pattern of government forces unlawfully targeting civilians for killings, rapes, torture&#8230;and destruction of property..” The victims are from ethnic groups suspected to support the rebels.</p>\\n<p><strong>AGNES</strong>: They are doing it, because they know very well that those soldiers are our brothers. So they do it to punish them..</p>\\n<p><strong>SIMONA FOLTYN</strong>: Although the rebels, known as the Sudan People’s Liberation Army In Opposition, purport to protect local communities, there are also reports of their fighters assaulting civilians near the Ugandan border. Josephine Yanya told us she didn’t feel safe in the presence of either side’s soldiers. Her family and neighbors fled their village after government soldiers killed her uncle.</p>\\n<p>They hid in the mountains only to find themselves under attack again, this time by opposition fighters from the Nuer tribe loyal to former vice president Riek Machar. Yanya says ethnic Nuer soldiers from the SPLA-IO rebel group raped a member of her group and stole her father&#8217;s’ cattle.</p>\\n<p><strong>JOSEPHINE YANYA</strong> (translated to English): Before we were thinking that the rebels would protect us, but if they are lacking food, they just come and take things by force.</p>\\n<p><strong>SIMONA FOLTYN</strong>: With nowhere left to hide, Yanya fled to Uganda with her son.<br />\\nBut instead of finding a place to rebuild their lives, they are in limbo.

Over the course of four days, we walked more than 40 miles through the bush, escorted by rebel soldiers, to shed light on one of the world&#8217;s most underreported conflicts.</p>\\n<p>Reporting on South Sudan&#8217;s war, which began in 2013, has always been a challenge due to the risk and logistical hurdles associated with accessing remote areas where fighting takes place. But over the past year, covering the war and its humanitarian fallout has become particularly difficult. Since the beginning of this year, South Sudan&#8217;s government has banned at least 20 foreign journalists in an apparent effort to silence reporters who had a track record of critically reporting on the government.</p>\\n<div class=\"nhpullquote right\"> The war has had a devastating impact on South Sudanese communities, but much of it has remained out of the limelight of international media. </div>\\n<p>This systematic crackdown on the foreign press (South Sudanese journalists have long risked imprisonment and death for doing their work) coincided with two important developments. In November 2016, the United Nations warned that the violence being committed against civilians in the southern region of Equatoria risked spiraling into genocide. Then, in February, the UN declared a man-made famine, warning that 100,000 people were at risk of starving to death as a result of civil war.</p>\\n<p>Journalists seeking to cover these events were left with two equally unsavory options: self-censorship or a risky trip to rebel-held parts of the country. Only a handful of journalists have attempted the latter since fighting escalated in July last year. For us, this was our second embed with the rebels this year.</p>\\n<div class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" id=\"attachment_230700\" style=\"width: 689px;\"></div>\\n<p>We set off from a town in northern Uganda at five in the morning, bouncing along a bumpy dirt track towards the South Sudan border. Crammed into our four-wheel drive were rebel commander Martin Abucha, a dual American and South Sudanese citizen who we planned to profile for our PBS NewsHour Weekend segment, a couple of guides, and several duffle bags stuffed with our tents, sleeping bags, emergency medical kits and provisions to last us four days.  </p>\\n<p>Just as the sun began to rise above a distant range of hills that we aimed to cross later that day, our car came to a halt in front of a stream. Because of the rainy reason, it carried more water than usual. It was time to disembark and start walking, or &#8220;footing,&#8221; as South Sudanese tend to call it.</p>\\n<p>We took off our shoes and waded through the stream&#8217;s chilly waters. This was the first of a many rivers we&#8217;d have to cross along the way, either on foot or in small flimsy canoes dug out from tree trunks. Each time, we dreaded the idea of falling in with our camera gear. </p>\\n<p>The first part of our journey in northern Uganda felt very much like a hike through a national park. Passing beautiful landscapes and idyllic farming villages, one could almost forget we were headed into a war zone &#8212; but we were about to get a reality check.</p>\\n<p>We had just crossed into South Sudan when out of nowhere, two dozen armed men popped out of the tall grass and surrounded us at gunpoint.</p>\\n<p>&#8220;Stop! Who are you and where are you going?&#8221; a soldier called out in Juba Arabic from his hideout no more than 20 yards away, pointing his AK47 at us. Another one next to him had a rocket-propelled grenade propped on his shoulder, also unequivocally aiming it in our direction.  </p>\\n<p>Instinctively, we threw our hands in the air and exchanged a baffled glance. Had we accidentally bumped into government soldiers? Or perhaps we had come onto the &#8220;wrong&#8221; rebels? Abucha&#8217;s group, called the Sudan People&#8217;s Liberation Army In Opposition, is the biggest but not the only armed group in Equatoria, an area rife with rival militia and bandits who exploit the security vacuum left by war.</p>\\n<p>To our relief, and only after Abucha answered a series of questions, this routine security check quickly gave way to a warm welcome. The platoon would be our escort for the next four days as we trekked to their base and to Loa, Abucha&#8217;s hometown.</p>\\n<p>Keeping up with the rebels was no easy task. Given the country&#8217;s pervasive lack of basic infrastructure, South Sudanese grow up walking for dozens of miles just to go about their daily lives. For sedentary Westerners, keeping the target pace of &#8220;two meters per second&#8221; (around five miles an hour) proved challenging amid 90-degree temperatures, all while filming and plowing our way through dense, itchy elephant grass. </p>\\n<p>The upside of the cumbersome terrain was that it kept us safe. During our four-day trip, we didn&#8217;t cross a single road, instead walking along a dizzying network of narrow bush paths the rebels seemed to know like the backs of their hands. An unwanted encounter with government troops, who tended to stick to roads and move around in vehicles as opposed to on foot, was highly unlikely.</p>\\n<p>The closest we got to government-controlled area was a visit to Loa, located just two kilometers away from a main road frequently patrolled by government soldiers. We couldn&#8217;t stay long, but the hour we spent on the ground offered us a glimpse into what villages must look like in many parts of Equatoria: burned mud huts, looted schools and clinics, fallow fields and – most strikingly – no civilians.  </p>\\n<p>The war has had a devastating impact on South Sudanese communities like the one in Loa, but much of it has remained out of the limelight of international media. Our four-day venture into rebel-held South Sudan offered us a rare opportunity to report ground truths, and we are thankful for that.</p>\\n<p>The post <a href=\"http://www.pbs.org/newshour/updates/reporters-notebook-reporting-south-sudan-difficult-critically-needed/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Column: Why reporting from South Sudan is so difficult &#8212; and critically needed</a> appeared first on <a href=\"http://www.pbs.org/newshour\" rel=\"nofollow\">PBS NewsHour</a>.</p>'}], 'wfw_commentrss': 'http://www.pbs.org/newshour/updates/reporters-notebook-reporting-south-sudan-difficult-critically-needed/feed/', 'slash_comments': '0', 'media_content': [{'url': 'http://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/newshour/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Simona-Foltyn-walks-down-a-mountain-slope-shortly-after-crossing-into-South-Sudan-1024x684.jpg', 'medium': 'image'}]}]\n",

They&#8217;re quick. They&#8217;re smart.</p>\\n<p><strong>MARCIA BIGGS:</strong> Fawzi al Nabdi is the team leader for the Iraqi local partner. He&#8217;s cleared mines all over Iraq for the last six years.</p>\\n<p><strong>CHRISTIAN:</strong> What you got?</p>\\n<p><strong>FAWZI AL NABDI,</strong> Team Leader, Al Fahad Company (through interpreter): We are ready for this, because it&#8217;s my job and I love it. The Americans are here to complete our work and to help us. They have greater experience than we do. If we find any mines, we have to stop and they will investigate it and make a plan to remove it.</p>\\n<p><strong>MARCIA BIGGS:</strong> But he says Mosul is the biggest project he has ever seen, and we&#8217;re told it could take at least a month to just get the campus cleared of mines. Only then can they start cleaning it up, so that students can resume classes, this itself a huge task.</p>\\n<p>ISIS fighters closed the university back in 2014, and used it as a military base. As coalition forces pounded ISIS targets, this seat of higher learning became a battleground.</p>\\n<p>Ghassan Alubaidy is the institute&#8217;s dean.</p>\\n<p><strong>GHASSAN ALUBAIDY,</strong> Dean, Mosul Technical Institute (through interpreter): ISIS used our university to manufacture mines and bombs. For this reason, it was the target of airstrikes in the beginning. They struck the institute nine times, and they struck our workshops, too. Now we can&#8217;t use them.</p>\\n<p><strong>MARCIA BIGGS:</strong> The former commander of coalition forces in Iraq, Lieutenant General Stephen Townsend, recently listed 81 locations where bombs were dropped, but had not yet exploded.</p>\\n<p>Facilities used to make weapons were often on the list of high-value targets for the coalition. So now those places are twice as likely to contain dangerous items.</p>\\n<p>So, this was once a workshop for electrical engineering students. You can still see the lab tables here. It was hit by an airstrike in 2015. Afterwards, members of the university staff found bomb-making instructions among the rubble. This was likely an ISIS bomb-making factory, and judging by the crater, a high-value target.</p>\\n<p>Despite the damage, Dean Alubaidy says he will hold classes this fall in alternate buildings, until the campus is ready. He&#8217;s expecting registration to be in the thousands, students who lost three years of education during the fighting and don&#8217;t want to lose another one.</p>\\n<p><strong>GHASSAN ALUBAIDY</strong> (through interpreter): On our Facebook pages, we found a great number of students posting that they were full of encouragement to come back. For us, it was unbelievable. We couldn&#8217;t imagine it, to see how many students wanted to start again, how they were dreaming of the first day of classes, when they could sit in front of teachers again and start to live their lives again.</p>\\n<p><strong>MARCIA BIGGS:</strong> Next door, Mosul University has already started classes. Students even volunteered to help in the cleanup.</p>\\n<p>But across the river, West Mosul was the site of ISIS&#8217; last stand and bore the brunt of the battle. It&#8217;s densely packed Old City, with its flattened buildings, is a challenge for mine-sweeping.</p>\\n<p><strong>FAWZI AL-NABDI</strong> (through interpreter): Most of the homes here were full of mines. And just here in front of us, a man with two kids came back to his home, and when he opened the door, the bomb killed him and his kids.</p>\\n<p><strong>MARCIA BIGGS:</strong> Ahmed Younes fled back in early July with only the clothes on his back. Residents have been virtually banned from returning to his neighborhood on the outskirts of the Old City, but Ahmed said he got special permission, in order to retrieve some personal items.</p>\\n<p><strong>AHMED YOUNES,</strong> Local Resident (through interpreter): We came on our own. We got permission to come, but they are not responsible if anything happens to us.</p>\\n<p><strong>MARCIA BIGGS:</strong> Right now, there is no plan to begin clearing the Old City or even to determine how many mines there are. It is still out of bounds to anyone but the Iraqi security forces.</p>\\n<p>So the Janus team is focusing on progress in the rest of the city, building by building, bomb by bomb.</p>\\n<p><strong>CHRISTIAN:</strong> Whoever made this device had a set goal. And to allow him to win, people get hurt. So you kind of compete against him to be better than him to take it out before it can do any harm.</p>\\n<p><strong>MARCIA BIGGS:</strong> So, you feel like you&#8217;re winning the battle against ISIS?</p>\\n<p>CHRISTIAN: Yes, one IED at a time.</p>\\n<p><strong>MARCIA BIGGS:</strong> For the PBS NewsHour, I&#8217;m Marcia Biggs in Mosul, Iraq.</p>\\n<p><strong>HARI SREENIVASAN:</strong> Tune in later.</p>\\n<p>Frontline&#8217;s latest film, &#8220;Mosul,&#8221; was on the ground filming the fight as it unfolded street by street and house by house.

And it looks as though this demonstration isn&#8217;t going any further.</p>\\n<p>Violence briefly erupts as the resistance movement tries to break through police lines, and several marchers are arrested.</p>\\n<p><strong>PAULINA FORSLUND</strong>: We are not your enemy. We are the government&#8217;s enemy.</p>\\n<p>They say we live in a democracy, but we have never had an election about if we want to take all these people in.</p>\\n<p><strong>MALCOLM BRABANT:</strong> When Europe&#8217;s refugee crisis began in 2015, Sweden copied Germany&#8217;s open-door policy, and 160,000 migrants entered the country. Two years on, Sweden has tighter borders and has begun deporting some of the newcomers.</p>\\n<p>The new atmosphere alarms Floid Gumbo, entertaining an anti-Nazi rally.</p>\\n<p><strong>FLOID GUMBO,</strong> Singer Originally from Zimbabwe: I came to Sweden over 20 years ago. The climate in Sweden, the people were so friendly, and things were completely different, more welcoming. And I feel like things have sort of gradually changed.</p>\\n<p>I&#8217;m very concerned, because I have children, because I&#8217;m thinking what I experienced here is not the same kind of climate, atmosphere that they are going to experience here.</p>\\n<p><strong>ANNA JOHANSSON:</strong> It&#8217;s not so long ago that the Nazis ruined Europe. And that makes me very worried. The German elections were terrifying, I think.</p>\\n<p><strong>MALCOLM BRABANT:</strong> Johansson is referring to last month&#8217;s success of the right-wing Alternative For Germany Party, or AFD, when it entered Parliament for the first time with 13 percent of the vote.</p>\\n<p><strong>HUGH BRONSON,</strong> Alternative For Germany Party: The AFD only came into existence because Merkel deserted the traditional conservative Christian voters. They were looking for a home, and the AFD has offered them a safe place.</p>\\n<p><strong>MALCOLM BRABANT:</strong> Hugh Bronson is deputy leader of the AFD in Berlin.</p>\\n<p>Now his party, the third largest in Parliament, is demanding that Angela Merkel imposes tougher immigration rules.</p>\\n<p>Your opponents claim that you are a party of hate. What&#8217;s your response to that?</p>\\n<p><strong>HUGH BRONSON:</strong> We embrace foreigners who respect our laws, pay their taxes, send their children to school, and go about their normal life. The problem is with people who abuse the system to have a better life, or let others pay for their better lives, or who are criminals.</p>\\n<p><strong>MALCOLM BRABANT:</strong> Outside the opera house in Dresden, former East Germany, singer Luca Bergelt is dismayed by the political landscape shifting to the right.</p>\\n<p><strong>LUCA BERGELT,</strong>\\xa0Singer: My fear is that they will tear Europe apart. They are going to raise up the walls again. They&#8217;re going to build new walls between the countries, and that Europe will get more close into itself.</p>\\n<p><strong>MALCOLM BRABANT:</strong> Anti-immigrant sentiment is strong in Dresden. The city was the birthplace of a pan-European anti-Islamic movement, and it delivered the largest number of votes for the right-wing party.</p>\\n<p>On a holiday to celebrate German unification after the fall of communism, retired engineer Wilfried Schmidt explained why he sent a message to Angela Merkel.</p>\\n<p><strong>WILFRIED SCHMIDT,</strong>\\xa0Retired Engineer\\xa0(through interpretor): Let&#8217;s put it this way. We all need to recognize that Germany is undergoing social changes that are becoming harder to control. For one, there is mass immigration from difficult regions that is increasingly uncontrollable, of people with entirely different concepts of life, from fundamental differently structured societies that are problematic.</p>\\n<p><strong>MALCOLM BRABANT:</strong> About one million migrants poured into Germany in 2015. Chancellor Merkel consistently defended her pro-refugee policies, but now she has been punished by voters who believe she ignored their concerns.</p>\\n<p>Chancellor Merkel has promised to listen to the people who voted for the AFD, and she says she&#8217;s going to try to win them over with what she calls good politics. But she will not countenance having the party in her coalition.</p>\\n<p>But the chancellor needs to find new partners who are prepared to be tough on immigration.</p>\\n<p>As she tries to forge a coalition, the chancellor has agreed to put an annual cap of 200,000 on the number of immigrants, something she previously refused to do. But will it be enough to woo back people who deserted her at the election?</p>\\n<p>A question for Werner Patzelt, a political scientist at Dresden University.</p>\\n<p><strong>WERNER PATZELT,</strong> Dresden University: Since Chancellor Merkel has made so many U-turns in German domestic politics, it wouldn&#8217;t be a surprise if she would try to do a U-turn, also winning back AFD voters.</p>\\n<p>But this is a really hard political task, because so many of them are so much disappointed by the Christian Democratic Union in general, and by Chancellor Merkel in particular, that they will do anything to avoid going back.</p>\\n<p><strong>MALCOLM BRABANT:</strong> Back in Sweden, the governing party is horrified at the concept of conceding ground to right-wingers, and is trying to isolate them.</p>\\n<p><strong>ANNA JOHANSSON:</strong> Experience shows that, when you adopt the ideas from these right-wing parties, they spread. These parties have their agenda implemented by other parties. And I wouldn&#8217;t want to see that happen in Sweden.</p>\\n<p><strong>FLOID GUMBO:</strong> We&#8217;re all human beings. We share this world. We&#8217;re all here. There&#8217;s enough space for us all.</p>\\n<p><strong>MALCOLM BRABANT:</strong> But that&#8217;s an appeal that an increasing number of Swedes are rejecting, as the country and much of Europe go through a crisis of identity.</p>\\n<p>For the PBS NewsHour, I&#8217;m Malcolm Brabant in Gothenburg.</p>\\n<p>The post <a href=\"http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/far-right-groups-gain-ground-sweden-germany-amid-migrant-influx/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Far-right groups gain ground in Sweden and Germany amid migrant influx</a> appeared first on <a href=\"http://www.pbs.org/newshour\" rel=\"nofollow\">PBS NewsHour</a>.</p>'}], 'wfw_commentrss': 'http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/far-right-groups-gain-ground-sweden-germany-amid-migrant-influx/feed/', 'slash_comments': '0', 'itunes_duration': '9:12', 'media_content': [{'url': 'http://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/newshour/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/RTS1GSQT-1024x659.jpg', 'medium': 'image'}]}, {'title': 'U.S.-backed Syrian forces recapture Raqqa from Islamic State group', 'title_detail': {'type': 'text/plain', 'language': None, 'base': 'http://feeds.feedburner.com/NewshourWorld', 'value': 'U.S.-backed Syrian forces recapture Raqqa from Islamic State group'}, 'links': [{'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html', 'href': 'http://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/u-s-backed-syrian-forces-recapture-raqqa-from-islamic-state-group/'}], 'link': 'http://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/u-s-backed-syrian-forces-recapture-raqqa-from-islamic-state-group/', 'comments': 'http://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/u-s-backed-syrian-forces-recapture-raqqa-from-islamic-state-group/#respond', 'published': 'Tue, 17 Oct 2017 16:57:20 +0000', 'published_parsed': time.struct_time(tm_year=2017, tm_mon=10, tm_mday=17, tm_hour=16, tm_min=57, tm_sec=20, tm_wday=1, tm_yday=290, tm_isdst=0), 'authors': [{'name': 'Larisa Epatko'}], 'author': 'Larisa Epatko', 'author_detail': {'name': 'Larisa Epatko'}, 'tags': [{'term': 'islamic state group', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}, {'term': 'raqqa', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}, {'term': 'Syria', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}], 'id': 'http://www.pbs.org/newshour/?post_type=rundown&p=230913', 'guidislink': False, 'summary': 'U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces announced Tuesday that they had captured the city of Raqqa from Islamic State militants.', 'summary_detail': {'type': 'text/plain', 'language': None, 'base': 'http://feeds.feedburner.com/NewshourWorld', 'value': 'U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces announced Tuesday that they had captured the city of Raqqa from Islamic State militants.'}, 'content': [{'type': 'text/html', 'language': None, 'base': 'http://feeds.feedburner.com/NewshourWorld', 'value': '<div class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_230912\" style=\"width: 689px;\"></div>\\n<p>U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces announced Tuesday that they had <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-41646802\">captured the city of Raqqa</a> from Islamic State militants.</p>\\n<p>&#8220;Everything is finished in Raqqa, our forces have taken full control of Raqqa,&#8221; SDF spokesman Talal Sello told <a href=\"https://www.afp.com/en/news/23/islamic-state-group-loses-emblematic-syria-stronghold-raqa\">AFP</a>.

By midday, Iraqi soldiers, along with state-backed militias, quickly took control of several massive oil fields north of the city. Iraqis also captured Kirkuk&#8217;s military airport and various government buildings. They lowered what had been a symbolic Kurdish flag at the governor&#8217;s compound.</p>\\n<p>Journalist Rebecca Collard in Irbil was in Kirkuk this morning.</p>\\n<p><strong>REBECCA COLLARD,</strong> Journalist: You could hear some clashes, some gunfire in the distance, but for the most part, the city seemed more or less abandoned.

The Iraqi federal government, Turkey, Iran and the U.S. all rejected the independence drive.</p>\\n<p>The multiethnic region of Kirkuk lies just outside of the autonomous Kurdish region in Iraq&#8217;s north. Called the country&#8217;s oil capital, Kirkuk produces around 500,000 barrels a day.</p>\\n<p>In 2014, amid the ISIS onslaught across Northern Iraq, the Kurds took control of Kirkuk, as the Iraqi military fled the city. In the three years since, the Kurds, led by their president, Massoud Barzani, sought to cement their hold, despite tensions with the central government.</p>\\n<p>Today, Kurdish officials accused Iraq of carrying out a major multipronged attack.</p>\\n<p><strong>MAJ. GEN. AYOUB YUSUF SAID,</strong> Peshmerga Commander (through interpreter): I don&#8217;t know what is happening exactly, because we have been in this fight since 4:00 in the morning.

They didn&#8217;t fire a single shot.</p>\\n<p><strong>LISA DESJARDINS:</strong> While Kurdish forces withdrew from posts south of the city, some residents vowed to die fighting. Thousands of others fled north.</p>\\n<p><strong>REBECCA COLLARD:</strong> For the last few years, the Iraqi forces, these primarily Shia militia, the Hashed Shaabi, and the Kurdish forces have been focused on fighting ISIS.

Both the Kurdish forces and Iraqi government troops are part of the coalition fighting ISIS. The U.S. sought to downplay the fighting, labeling the exchange of gunfire a misunderstanding.</p>\\n<p>And, in the Rose Garden, President Trump tried to stay neutral.</p>\\n<p><strong>PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP:</strong> We don&#8217;t like the fact that they&#8217;re clashing. We&#8217;re not taking sides. But we don&#8217;t like the fact that they&#8217;re clashing.</p>\\n<p><strong>LISA DESJARDINS:</strong> For the PBS NewsHour, I&#8217;m Lisa Desjardins.</p>\\n<p><strong>JUDY WOODRUFF:</strong> For more, I&#8217;m joined now by Emma Sky. She served as an adviser to General David Petraeus while he was commander of U.S. forces in Iraq from 2007 to 2010, and by Feisal Istrabadi. He&#8217;s a former Iraqi ambassador to the United Nations and he helped write Iraq&#8217;s interim constitution.</p>\\n<p>Welcome to both of you.</p>\\n<p>Let me start with you, Emma Sky.</p>\\n<p>This has happened so quickly. What exactly has the Iraqi government done?</p>\\n<p><strong>EMMA SKY,</strong>\\xa0Yale University: The Iraqi government has deployed its forces back up north into Kirkuk.</p>\\n<p>And since 2003, the Kurds have made it clear that they want to include Kirkuk within their territory in order to proceed with gaining independence, which has always been their goal. But Kirkuk is important to Iraq itself, and no Iraqi prime minister can afford to lose Kirkuk.</p>\\n<p>So you can see this reaction that has taken place following the referendum on independence, which happened September the 25th, and also included the disputed territories and the city of Kirkuk.</p>\\n<p><strong>JUDY WOODRUFF:</strong> Feisal Istrabadi, what can you add to why the Iraqi government is so set on taking over the city?</p>\\n<p><strong>FEISAL ISTRABADI,</strong> Former Deputy UN Ambassador, Iraq: Well, a couple of reasons.</p>\\n<p>First, as Emma just said, it is a part of the disputed territories, which are legally and constitutionally under the jurisdiction of the federal government in Baghdad. The KRG expanded into these disputed territories at the time when ISIL was expanding its territory, and then began to take steps to unilaterally declare that these areas were now incorporated into the Kurdistan region, including when it held the referendum that Emma talked about.</p>\\n<p>It included holding the referendum in these disputed territories. Now, so long as Iraq &#8212; so long as we&#8217;re talking about a single country, it matters a little less who controls Kirkuk, but once the referendum was held, this gave rise then to the second reason for Baghdad choosing to act now.</p>\\n<p>As Emma said, Kirkuk is an important oil-producing zone in Iraq. And it is vital for the economic viability of an independent Kurdish state and an important part of the economic viability of the Iraqi state. So there was never going to be a scenario, I think, in which Baghdad would allow a unilateral exercise of control by Kurds to occur over Kirkuk, so long as independence is on the table.</p>\\n<p><strong>JUDY WOODRUFF:</strong> Emma Sky, we heard President Trump say today the U.S. is not taking sides in this.</p>\\n<p>Is that accurate, that the U.S. isn&#8217;t taking sides? What is the U.S. role here?</p>\\n<p><strong>EMMA SKY:</strong> Well, the U.S. has stipulated over and over again that its policy is to support a united Iraq.</p>\\n<p>So you can see the U.S. has given support to Iraqi security forces, but also to the Kurdish Peshmerga, to fight against ISIS. The U.S. policy for the last few years has really been focused on ISIS and not on the day after ISIS.</p>\\n<p>But what we&#8217;re witnessing at the moment is that different groups are already moving to the day after, which is the power struggle for control of different territories in Iraq.</p>\\n<p>And Barzani believed that during the fight against ISIS, he became stronger because he got weapons directly from the international community. And, as Feisal said, he was able to extend his control over the disputed territories.</p>\\n<p>He&#8217;s also facing domestic problems within Kurdistan. There are tensions between the different Kurdish groups, and some believe that Barzani has overstayed his term as president.</p>\\n<p><strong>JUDY WOODRUFF:</strong> Which reminds us just how complicated this is, Feisal Istrabadi.</p>\\n<p>What does the Iraqi central government want here? They&#8217;re not going to get rid of the Kurds. What is it that they want?</p>\\n<p><strong>FEISAL ISTRABADI:</strong> Oh, well, I mean, the Kurds of course are a vital part of Iraq. They&#8217;re a vital part of the political process, and they have been represented in Baghdad. The president of Iraq is a Kurd and has been since 2005.</p>\\n<p>I think what needs to occur and I hope what the government of Iraq wants is a negotiated settlement, in which no party dictates terms to the other, but a negotiated settlement.</p>\\n<p>Look, Irbil has some legitimate agreements with respect to Baghdad. Baghdad has some legitimate agreements with respect to Irbil. I think we need a mediator perhaps or somebody to convene a roundtable &#8212; the United States is who I&#8217;m thinking of, of course &#8212; to address some of those issues.</p>\\n<p>Most of the issues are, from the Irbil side, economic issues of payments, and from Baghdad&#8217;s side, transparency of how much oil Irbil is producing and exporting, which Irbil has never accounted for to Baghdad.</p>\\n<p>I think if those issues are resolved, perhaps hopefully some of these other issues can at least be delayed for another day. But at the end of the day, neither government &#8212; neither the regional government nor the federal government in Baghdad can really tolerate dictation of terms to it by the other side. My hope is that a negotiated settlement obtains.</p>\\n<p><strong>JUDY WOODRUFF:</strong> Emma Sky, where do you see this going from here? Do you see the peace that different sides have worked to hard to create in Iraq unraveling as a result of this?</p>\\n<p><strong>EMMA SKY:</strong> I think there is an opportunity for a deal, and I think the sort of deal that could be negotiated is one that looks at a special status for the city of Kirkuk and negotiated terms for Kurdistan&#8217;s separate, whether that be towards confederation or towards independence.</p>\\n<p>But there needs to be negotiation. There needs to be a look at where should the border between Iraqi Kurdistan and the rest of Iraq actually be, and that requires mediation district by district through those territories.</p>\\n<p><strong>JUDY WOODRUFF:</strong> Well, we know there are other players who are playing an important role here in Iran and Turkey, and this is all very much playing out as we watch, watch it happen in Iraq.</p>\\n<p>Emma Sky, Feisal Istrabadi, thank you very much.</p>\\n<p><strong>FEISAL ISTRABADI:</strong> Thank you.</p>\\n<p><strong>EMMA SKY:</strong> Thank you.</p>\\n<p>The post <a href=\"http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/power-struggle-broken-kirkuk/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Why a power struggle has broken out over Kirkuk</a> appeared first on <a href=\"http://www.pbs.org/newshour\" rel=\"nofollow\">PBS NewsHour</a>.</p>'}], 'wfw_commentrss': 'http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/power-struggle-broken-kirkuk/feed/', 'slash_comments': '0', 'itunes_duration': '10:32', 'media_content': [{'url': 'http://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/newshour/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/RTS1GMUL-1024x629.jpg', 'medium': 'image'}]}, {'title': 'Rex Tillerson says continue diplomacy with North Korea ‘until first bomb drops’', 'title_detail': {'type': 'text/plain', 'language': None, 'base': 'http://feeds.feedburner.com/NewshourWorld', 'value': 'Rex Tillerson says continue diplomacy with North Korea ‘until first bomb drops’'}, 'links': [{'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html', 'href': 'http://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/rex-tillerson-says-continue-diplomacy-north-korea-first-bomb-drops/'}], 'link': 'http://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/rex-tillerson-says-continue-diplomacy-north-korea-first-bomb-drops/', 'comments': 'http://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/rex-tillerson-says-continue-diplomacy-north-korea-first-bomb-drops/#respond', 'published': 'Mon, 16 Oct 2017 11:08:00 +0000', 'published_parsed': time.struct_time(tm_year=2017, tm_mon=10, tm_mday=16, tm_hour=11, tm_min=8, tm_sec=0, tm_wday=0, tm_yday=289, tm_isdst=0), 'authors': [{'name': 'Laura Santhanam'}], 'author': 'Laura Santhanam', 'author_detail': {'name': 'Laura Santhanam'}, 'tags': [{'term': 'Donald Trump', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}, {'term': 'Kim Jong Un', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}, {'term': 'North Korea', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}, {'term': 'Rex Tillerson', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}], 'id': 'http://www.pbs.org/newshour/?post_type=rundown&p=230760', 'guidislink': False, 'summary': 'That statement comes despite President Donald Trump\\'s tweets a couple of weeks ago that his chief envoy was \"wasting his time\" trying to negotiate with \"Little Rocket Man,\" a mocking nickname Trump has given the nuclear-armed nation\\'s leader, Kim Jong Un.', 'summary_detail': {'type': 'text/plain', 'language': None, 'base': 'http://feeds.feedburner.com/NewshourWorld', 'value': 'That statement comes despite President Donald Trump\\'s tweets a couple of weeks ago that his chief envoy was \"wasting his time\" trying to negotiate with \"Little Rocket Man,\" a mocking nickname Trump has given the nuclear-armed nation\\'s leader, Kim Jong Un.'}, 'content': [{'type': 'text/html', 'language': None, 'base': 'http://feeds.feedburner.com/NewshourWorld', 'value': '<div class=\"wp-caption alignright\" id=\"attachment_229698\" style=\"width: 689px;\"></div>\\n<p>WASHINGTON — Secretary of State Rex Tillerson says diplomatic efforts aimed at resolving the North Korean crisis &#8220;will continue until the first bomb drops.&#8221;</p>\\n<p>That statement comes despite President Donald Trump&#8217;s tweets a couple of weeks ago that his chief envoy was &#8220;wasting his time&#8221; trying to negotiate with &#8220;Little Rocket Man,&#8221; a mocking nickname Trump has given the nuclear-armed nation&#8217;s leader, Kim Jong Un.</p>\\n<p>&#8220;I think he does want to be clear with Kim Jong Un and that regime in North Korea that he has military preparations ready to go and he has those military options on the table.

He provided no elaboration about those channels or the substance of any discussions.</p>\\n<p>Soon after, Trump took to Twitter, saying he had told &#8220;our wonderful Secretary of State, that he is wasting his time trying to negotiate with Little Rocket Man &#8230; Save your energy Rex, we&#8217;ll do what has to be done!&#8221; Trump offered no further explanation, but he said all military options are on the table for dealing with North Korea&#8217;s nuclear and missile programs.</p>\\n<p>Analysts have speculated about whether the president and his top diplomat were playing &#8220;good cop, bad cop&#8221; with North Korea, and how China might interpret the confusing signals from Washington. Beijing is the North&#8217;s main trading partner, and the U.S. is counting on China to enforce U.N. sanctions.</p>\\n<p>&#8220;Rest assured that the Chinese are not confused in any way what the American policy towards North Korea (is) or what our actions and efforts are directed at,&#8221; Tillerson said.</p>\\n<p>Asked if Trump&#8217;s tweets undermined Tillerson, the secretary said: &#8220;I think what the president is doing is he&#8217;s trying to motivate action on a number of people&#8217;s part, in particular the regime in North Korea. I think he does want to be clear with Kim Jong Un and that regime in North Korea that he has military preparations ready to go and he has those military options on the table and we have spent substantial time perfecting those.&#8221;</p>\\n<p>He added that Trump &#8220;has made it clear to me to continue my diplomatic efforts, which we are, and I&#8217;ve told others those diplomatic efforts will continue until the first bomb drops.&#8221;</p>\\n<p>North Korea has launched missiles that potentially can strike the U.S. mainland and recently conducted its largest ever underground nuclear explosion.

Kirkuk also has 10% of Iraq&#8217;s known oil reserves. Washington Post&#8217;s Loveday Morris is in Baghdad covering this standoff joins me now via Skype. First of all the significance of this. Why is it so important?</p>\\n<p><strong>LOVEDAY MORRIS:</strong> There&#8217;s been a longtime conflict between Baghdad and Kurdistan over these disputed territories. Most significant of which is Kirkuk because of the oil reserves. But the referendum last month has really sharpened these disputes because you have Baghdad opposing independence and so it feels like they have to restate its territorial claims these areas. So that&#8217;s why we&#8217;re seeing a lot of tension right now. </p>\\n<p><strong>HARI SREENIVASAN:</strong> And just to give people a little bit of a brief timeline &#8211; Iraqi forces control this area for a while and then in June ISIS took over the area and now it&#8217;s kind of back in Kurdish hands?</p>\\n<p><strong>LOVEDAY MORRIS:</strong> Right. So in June 2014 Iraq lost control of a lot of the areas and we have this huge collapse in the face of an ISIS offensive. Over 100,000 soldiers fled and Kurdish forces moved in some of these areas &#8211; some of them maybe took from ISIS and others just moved into into the vacuum. And so Iraqi forces have been in these areas since June 2014. And that&#8217;s their main demand that they return to the areas. </p>\\n<p><strong>HARI SREENIVASAN:</strong> What&#8217;s the likelihood that this standoff right now turns violent? Into some sort of a civil war?</p>\\n<p><strong>LOVEDAY MORRIS:</strong>: I think at this point both sides don&#8217;t want violence. Al-Abadi, the prime minister, is really trying to defuse the situation by saying there&#8217;s going to be no  military attack. But at the same time there is this buildup of forces so that I think they are trying to, in a way, intimidate the Kurds to withdraw from some areas but they don&#8217;t want to see a fight per say. But in this really tense situation there can be a small spark and things can turn violent quite easily.</p>\\n<p><strong>HARI SREENIVASAN:</strong> Thank you. </p>\\n<p>The post <a href=\"http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/iraqi-kurdish-forces-standoff-weeks-kurdish-vote-independence/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Iraqi, Kurdish forces in standoff, weeks after Kurdish vote for independence</a> appeared first on <a href=\"http://www.pbs.org/newshour\" rel=\"nofollow\">PBS NewsHour</a>.</p>'}], 'wfw_commentrss': 'http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/iraqi-kurdish-forces-standoff-weeks-kurdish-vote-independence/feed/', 'slash_comments': '0', 'itunes_duration': '00:02:58', 'media_content': [{'url': 'http://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/newshour/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/RTS1GDM5-1024x626.jpg', 'medium': 'image'}]}, {'title': 'South Sudan civil war causes Africa’s worst refugee crisis', 'title_detail': {'type': 'text/plain', 'language': None, 'base': 'http://feeds.feedburner.com/NewshourWorld', 'value': 'South Sudan civil war causes Africa’s worst refugee crisis'}, 'links': [{'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html', 'href': 'http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/south-sudan-civil-war-causes-africas-worst-refugee-crisis/'}, {'length': '2110000', 'type': 'audio/mpeg', 'href': 'https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/newshour/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/PNWE20171015_SouthSudanRefugees_WEB.mp3', 'rel': 'enclosure'}], 'link': 'http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/south-sudan-civil-war-causes-africas-worst-refugee-crisis/', 'comments': 'http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/south-sudan-civil-war-causes-africas-worst-refugee-crisis/#respond', 'published': 'Sun, 15 Oct 2017 19:26:17 +0000', 'published_parsed': time.struct_time(tm_year=2017, tm_mon=10, tm_mday=15, tm_hour=19, tm_min=26, tm_sec=17, tm_wday=6, tm_yday=288, tm_isdst=0), 'authors': [{'name': 'PBS NewsHour'}], 'author': 'PBS NewsHour', 'author_detail': {'name': 'PBS NewsHour'}, 'tags': [{'term': 'africa', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}, {'term': 'NewsHour Weekend', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}, {'term': 'refugee crisis', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}, {'term': 'South Sudan', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}], 'id': 'http://www.pbs.org/newshour/?post_type=bb&p=230720', 'guidislink': False, 'summary': 'South Sudan’s four-year civil war has left half of the nation’s population, 6 million people, in need of humanitarian aid and caused one of the world’s worst refugee crises.

The conflict began when South Sudan’s army split between factions loyal to President Salva Kiir and former Vice President Riek Machar. The two men mobilized their respective tribes, the Dinka and the Nuer. The war has caused what is now one of the world’s worst refugee crises.</p>\\n<p><strong>SIMONA FOLTYN</strong>: Civil war is emptying huge swaths of South Sudan. The violence has uprooted four million people, including two million who’ve fled to neighboring countries. In the last year, more than a million South Sudanese have poured into northern Uganda alone, crossing makeshift bridges like this one to flee fighting, hunger, and brutal attacks on civilians.</p>\\n<p><strong>SEME LUPAI, REFUGE</strong>E: They started fighting very, very severely. So that made us to escape with our properties to this side.</p>\\n<p><strong>SIMONA FOLTYN</strong>: When Seme Lupai’s family went to one of the refugee camps, initially, he stayed behind to look after the family’s most precious commodity &#8212; their cattle. He hid for a year to escape the violence. The refugees carry whatever they can salvage &#8212; mattresses, pots, clothes, notebooks &#8212; remnants of once peaceful lives turned upside down. At checkpoints, Ugandan soldiers search their belongings for weapons, before the refugees proceed to reception centers. After entering Uganda, the refugees sign in at small waystations. For many, it’s the first night spent in safety after walking for days to escape fighting. Levi Arike fled with his wife and four children.</p>\\n<p><strong>LEVI ARIKE, REFUGEE</strong>: When the gunshots started, we laid under a tree with the whole family, because there was nowhere else to hide. We waited for the fighting to stop, and then we got up and started walking to Uganda.</p>\\n<p><strong>SIMONA FOLTYN</strong>: Uganda now shoulders most of the burden of Africa’s biggest refugee crisis, managing a constellation of camps which require food, water, healthcare, and policing. At Imvepi Camp, now home to more than 120,000 South Sudanese, new arrivals receive vaccinations, hot meals, and basic items such as soap and plastic tarps to build a house. The government also gives each refugee family a small plot of land, about a twentieth of an acre, where they can build a tent shelter and grow crops to eat or sell. But the land often proves too rocky for farming.</p>\\n<p><strong>SIMONA FOLTYN, IMVEPI REFUGEE CAMP, NORTHERN UGANDA</strong>: After completing the registration process, the new arrivals will receive their plot, to start a new life as refugees in Uganda. While they are safe here, there are many challenges ahead, not least processing the trauma of what they experienced back home.</p>\\n<p>This woman, who we’ll call “Agnes,” agreed to tell us about her harrowing experience. She says four government soldiers from President Salva Kiir’s Dinka tribe stopped her as she was fleeing South Sudan and raped her right in front of her family.</p>\\n<p><strong>AGNES</strong> (translated to English): When they started raping me, they told me not to raise alarm, otherwise they would shoot me. Still when I’m sleeping, I’m dreaming of the Dinka, that they are coming to rape me again.</p>\\n<p><strong>SIMONA FOLTYN</strong>: How often do you have those dreams?</p>\\n<p><strong>AGNES</strong>: Daily, every time I lie down, those dreams come.</p>\\n<p><strong>SIMONA FOLTYN</strong>: A recent Human Rights Watch report on South Sudan found “&#8230;a clear pattern of government forces unlawfully targeting civilians for killings, rapes, torture&#8230;and destruction of property..” The victims are from ethnic groups suspected to support the rebels.</p>\\n<p><strong>AGNES</strong>: They are doing it, because they know very well that those soldiers are our brothers. So they do it to punish them..</p>\\n<p><strong>SIMONA FOLTYN</strong>: Although the rebels, known as the Sudan People’s Liberation Army In Opposition, purport to protect local communities, there are also reports of their fighters assaulting civilians near the Ugandan border. Josephine Yanya told us she didn’t feel safe in the presence of either side’s soldiers. Her family and neighbors fled their village after government soldiers killed her uncle.</p>\\n<p>They hid in the mountains only to find themselves under attack again, this time by opposition fighters from the Nuer tribe loyal to former vice president Riek Machar. Yanya says ethnic Nuer soldiers from the SPLA-IO rebel group raped a member of her group and stole her father&#8217;s’ cattle.</p>\\n<p><strong>JOSEPHINE YANYA</strong> (translated to English): Before we were thinking that the rebels would protect us, but if they are lacking food, they just come and take things by force.</p>\\n<p><strong>SIMONA FOLTYN</strong>: With nowhere left to hide, Yanya fled to Uganda with her son.<br />\\nBut instead of finding a place to rebuild their lives, they are in limbo. And aid groups don’t have enough food to distribute.</p>\\n<p><strong>JOSEPHINE YANYA</strong> (translated to English):We are getting small food rations. I know it won’t be enough even for one month.</p>\\n<p><strong>SIMONA FOLTYN</strong>: According to the United Nations, the international community has given less than a-third of the $1.4 billion dollars needed for the refugee response in South Sudan’s neighboring countries. These refugees foresee more hardship and have no idea when they might return home.</p>\\n<p><strong>JOSEPHINE YANYA</strong> (translated to English): I’m always praying for peace in South Sudan, and until then, I’ll just stay here.</p>\\n<p>The post <a href=\"http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/south-sudan-civil-war-causes-africas-worst-refugee-crisis/\" rel=\"nofollow\">South Sudan civil war causes Africa’s worst refugee crisis</a> appeared first on <a href=\"http://www.pbs.org/newshour\" rel=\"nofollow\">PBS NewsHour</a>.</p>'}], 'wfw_commentrss': 'http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/south-sudan-civil-war-causes-africas-worst-refugee-crisis/feed/', 'slash_comments': '0', 'itunes_duration': '00:04:30', 'media_content': [{'url': 'http://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/newshour/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/RTX3905F-1024x683.jpg', 'medium': 'image'}]}, {'title': 'Hundreds dead after massive truck bomb strikes Mogadishu', 'title_detail': {'type': 'text/plain', 'language': None, 'base': 'http://feeds.feedburner.com/NewshourWorld', 'value': 'Hundreds dead after massive truck bomb strikes Mogadishu'}, 'links': [{'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html', 'href': 'http://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/hundreds-dead-massive-truck-bomb-strikes-mogadishu/'}], 'link': 'http://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/hundreds-dead-massive-truck-bomb-strikes-mogadishu/', 'comments': 'http://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/hundreds-dead-massive-truck-bomb-strikes-mogadishu/#respond', 'published': 'Sun, 15 Oct 2017 16:27:49 +0000', 'published_parsed': time.struct_time(tm_year=2017, tm_mon=10, tm_mday=15, tm_hour=16, tm_min=27, tm_sec=49, tm_wday=6, tm_yday=288, tm_isdst=0), 'authors': [{'name': 'reganm'}], 'author': 'reganm', 'author_detail': {'name': 'reganm'}, 'tags': [{'term': 'al-Shabab', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}, {'term': 'Mogadishu', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}, {'term': 'NewsHour Weekend', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}], 'id': 'http://www.pbs.org/newshour/?post_type=rundown&p=230705', 'guidislink': False, 'summary': \"At least 231 people were killed and hundreds more wounded after a massive truck bomb on Saturday struck Somalia's capital city of Mogadishu.\", 'summary_detail': {'type': 'text/plain', 'language': None, 'base': 'http://feeds.feedburner.com/NewshourWorld', 'value': \"At least 231 people were killed and hundreds more wounded after a massive truck bomb on Saturday struck Somalia's capital city of Mogadishu.\"}, 'content': [{'type': 'text/html', 'language': None, 'base': 'http://feeds.feedburner.com/NewshourWorld', 'value': '<div class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" id=\"attachment_230709\" style=\"width: 689px;\"></div>\\n<p>At least 231 people were killed and hundreds more wounded after a massive truck bomb on Saturday struck Somalia&#8217;s capital city of Mogadishu. </p>\\n<p>The Somali government has blamed the al-Qaida-linked militant group al-Shabab for the attack, and called it the deadliest ever to hit the nation.</p>\\n<p>The blast took place outside the Safari Hotel, where rescue workers dug through the rubble of collapsed buildings overnight in search of survivors.

Over the course of four days, we walked more than 40 miles through the bush, escorted by rebel soldiers, to shed light on one of the world&#8217;s most underreported conflicts.</p>\\n<p>Reporting on South Sudan&#8217;s war, which began in 2013, has always been a challenge due to the risk and logistical hurdles associated with accessing remote areas where fighting takes place. But over the past year, covering the war and its humanitarian fallout has become particularly difficult. Since the beginning of this year, South Sudan&#8217;s government has banned at least 20 foreign journalists in an apparent effort to silence reporters who had a track record of critically reporting on the government.</p>\\n<div class=\"nhpullquote right\"> The war has had a devastating impact on South Sudanese communities, but much of it has remained out of the limelight of international media. </div>\\n<p>This systematic crackdown on the foreign press (South Sudanese journalists have long risked imprisonment and death for doing their work) coincided with two important developments. In November 2016, the United Nations warned that the violence being committed against civilians in the southern region of Equatoria risked spiraling into genocide. Then, in February, the UN declared a man-made famine, warning that 100,000 people were at risk of starving to death as a result of civil war.</p>\\n<p>Journalists seeking to cover these events were left with two equally unsavory options: self-censorship or a risky trip to rebel-held parts of the country. Only a handful of journalists have attempted the latter since fighting escalated in July last year. For us, this was our second embed with the rebels this year.</p>\\n<div class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" id=\"attachment_230700\" style=\"width: 689px;\"></div>\\n<p>We set off from a town in northern Uganda at five in the morning, bouncing along a bumpy dirt track towards the South Sudan border. Crammed into our four-wheel drive were rebel commander Martin Abucha, a dual American and South Sudanese citizen who we planned to profile for our PBS NewsHour Weekend segment, a couple of guides, and several duffle bags stuffed with our tents, sleeping bags, emergency medical kits and provisions to last us four days.  </p>\\n<p>Just as the sun began to rise above a distant range of hills that we aimed to cross later that day, our car came to a halt in front of a stream. Because of the rainy reason, it carried more water than usual. It was time to disembark and start walking, or &#8220;footing,&#8221; as South Sudanese tend to call it.</p>\\n<p>We took off our shoes and waded through the stream&#8217;s chilly waters. This was the first of a many rivers we&#8217;d have to cross along the way, either on foot or in small flimsy canoes dug out from tree trunks. Each time, we dreaded the idea of falling in with our camera gear. </p>\\n<p>The first part of our journey in northern Uganda felt very much like a hike through a national park. Passing beautiful landscapes and idyllic farming villages, one could almost forget we were headed into a war zone &#8212; but we were about to get a reality check.</p>\\n<p>We had just crossed into South Sudan when out of nowhere, two dozen armed men popped out of the tall grass and surrounded us at gunpoint.</p>\\n<p>&#8220;Stop! Who are you and where are you going?&#8221; a soldier called out in Juba Arabic from his hideout no more than 20 yards away, pointing his AK47 at us. Another one next to him had a rocket-propelled grenade propped on his shoulder, also unequivocally aiming it in our direction.  </p>\\n<p>Instinctively, we threw our hands in the air and exchanged a baffled glance. Had we accidentally bumped into government soldiers? Or perhaps we had come onto the &#8220;wrong&#8221; rebels? Abucha&#8217;s group, called the Sudan People&#8217;s Liberation Army In Opposition, is the biggest but not the only armed group in Equatoria, an area rife with rival militia and bandits who exploit the security vacuum left by war.</p>\\n<p>To our relief, and only after Abucha answered a series of questions, this routine security check quickly gave way to a warm welcome. The platoon would be our escort for the next four days as we trekked to their base and to Loa, Abucha&#8217;s hometown.</p>\\n<p>Keeping up with the rebels was no easy task. Given the country&#8217;s pervasive lack of basic infrastructure, South Sudanese grow up walking for dozens of miles just to go about their daily lives. For sedentary Westerners, keeping the target pace of &#8220;two meters per second&#8221; (around five miles an hour) proved challenging amid 90-degree temperatures, all while filming and plowing our way through dense, itchy elephant grass. </p>\\n<p>The upside of the cumbersome terrain was that it kept us safe. During our four-day trip, we didn&#8217;t cross a single road, instead walking along a dizzying network of narrow bush paths the rebels seemed to know like the backs of their hands. An unwanted encounter with government troops, who tended to stick to roads and move around in vehicles as opposed to on foot, was highly unlikely.</p>\\n<p>The closest we got to government-controlled area was a visit to Loa, located just two kilometers away from a main road frequently patrolled by government soldiers. We couldn&#8217;t stay long, but the hour we spent on the ground offered us a glimpse into what villages must look like in many parts of Equatoria: burned mud huts, looted schools and clinics, fallow fields and – most strikingly – no civilians.  </p>\\n<p>The war has had a devastating impact on South Sudanese communities like the one in Loa, but much of it has remained out of the limelight of international media. Our four-day venture into rebel-held South Sudan offered us a rare opportunity to report ground truths, and we are thankful for that.</p>\\n<p>The post <a href=\"http://www.pbs.org/newshour/updates/reporters-notebook-reporting-south-sudan-difficult-critically-needed/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Column: Why reporting from South Sudan is so difficult &#8212; and critically needed</a> appeared first on <a href=\"http://www.pbs.org/newshour\" rel=\"nofollow\">PBS NewsHour</a>.</p>'}], 'wfw_commentrss': 'http://www.pbs.org/newshour/updates/reporters-notebook-reporting-south-sudan-difficult-critically-needed/feed/', 'slash_comments': '0', 'media_content': [{'url': 'http://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/newshour/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Simona-Foltyn-walks-down-a-mountain-slope-shortly-after-crossing-into-South-Sudan-1024x684.jpg', 'medium': 'image'}]}]\n"
